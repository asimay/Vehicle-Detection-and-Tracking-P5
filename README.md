**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

### Submission Contents & Execution

My project includes the following directories/files:

1. model_training directory containing data sets, pickled objects, training and test set preparation code, feature extraction code, and model training code

2. output_images directory containing a final output image from the pipeline (it was difficult to auto-generate each stageâ€™s output to this directory, so I took snapshots of the stages and put them in the writeup report 

3. output_video directory containing final output video: processed_project_video.mp4

4. sdcp4 directory containing all dependencies from project 4

5. test_images directory containing Udacity-provided pipeline test images (and a few I exported from the project video)

6. test_video directory containing Udacity-provided project videos: project_video.mp4 and test_video.mp4

7. main.py containing initialization, test (export final output image), and production (export processed video) pipeline execution code

8. production_pipeline.py containing code that processes each frame of the project video through my pipeline and produces a video saved to the output_video directory

9.  test_pipeline.py containing code that saves final output image from the pipeline to the output_images directory

10. vehicle_processor.py containing code that performs a vehicle search using a sliding window technique and a trained classifier, also thresholding code to deal with false positives and object labeling using heatmaps

11. writeup_template.md summarizing the results
